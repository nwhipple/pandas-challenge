Challenge 4
# Khaled Karman and Ask BCS helped me determing the average test scores per school (line 17). I struggled with the average test scores per school, provided my code, and then the tutor helped me by sending me an example of the corrected code.

# (line 68) Convert Per Student Budget to String: school_spending_df["Per Student Budget"] = school_spending_df["Per Student Budget"].str.replace("$","").astype(float) (Watched Debbie troubleshoot this section in the office hours and took the idea of making a separate cell for this conversion; Khaled (instructor) / helped me by writing this: .str.replace("$",""))

# I worked with the tutor on writing a few of the python scripts near the first half of the document, but I cannot remember which ones, or what kind of help was provided
